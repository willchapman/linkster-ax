# linkster-ax
A utility automating many-to-many links in Niagara AX

## Backwards Compatibility Note
This module is built with the following version of AX
  Niagara AX 3.8.38

Although it is built and version'ed for this build, it has no version dependency
and SHOULD be able to work all the way back to 3.0.  However, only official testing
has been done back to 3.5.  

If you find issues in older version of AX, please submit it here and I will 
investigate.
